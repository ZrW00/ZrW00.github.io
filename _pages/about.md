[Hidden Ghost Hand: Unveiling Backdoor Vulnerabilities in MLLM-Powered Mobile GUI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14418)

Pengzhou Cheng, Haowen Hu, Zheng Wu, Zongru Wu, Tianjie Ju, Daizong Ding, Zhuosheng Zhang, Gongshen Liu 

- We propose AgentGhost—a stealthy and effective red-teaming backdoor attack framework, which reveals that GUI agents powered by MLLMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks induced by interaction-level triggers. AgentGhost achieves 99.7% attack success with only 1% utility degradation, while our tailored defense reduces the attack success rate to 22.1%.

[Can Knowledge be Transferred from Unimodal to Multimodal? Investigating the Transitivity of Multimodal Knowledge Editing](https://iccv.thecvf.com/virtual/2025/poster/230)

Lingyong Fang, Xinzhong Wang, Depeng Wang, **Zongru Wu**, Ya Guo, Huijia Zhu, Zhuosheng Zhang, Gongshen Liu

- Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) contain a substantial amount of factual knowledge, which may become outdated or inaccurate over time. Consequently, various knowledge editing techniques have been proposed to update the knowledge encoded within these models. Previous approaches maintain modality consistency during both the editing and testing phases. However, in practical applications, it is desirable for knowledge to be transferable across different modalities, which can enhance the robustness of knowledge editing and potentially allow for cost-effective editing of multimodal knowledge using textual information. To address this, we introduce the concept of Transitivity of Multimodal Knowledge Editing (TMKE) and design corresponding evaluation criteria. Subsequently, we construct a corresponding TMKE Benchmark through an automated pipeline. We evaluate three MLLMs and five knowledge editing methods, uncovering limitations in the current models and methods concerning transitivity. Additionally, we analyze the intrinsic representations of the model during the editing process based on Knowledge Neurons to interpret the experimental phenomena.

[OS-Kairos: Adaptive Interaction for MLLM-Powered GUI Agents](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.348/)

Pengzhou Cheng, Zheng Wu, **Zongru Wu**, Aston Zhang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Gongshen Liu

- By predicting confidence levels at each interaction step, we are releasing an adaptive GUI agent (OS-Kairos) that alleviates the over-execution of autonomous GUI agents, and significantly improves task success rates in complex scenarios.

**Zongru Wu**, Pengzhou Cheng, Zheng Wu, Tianjie Ju, Zhuosheng Zhang, Gongshen Liu

- We propose a pivot task name query inference to smooth coordinate-oriented grounding and action-oriented reasoning, enhancing the comprehension of user intent and imporoving the performance of MLLM-powered GUI agents in resource-constrained scenarios.

- We propose maxEntropy, an entropy-based poisoning filter that accurately detects existing task-agnostic backdoors. To further expose the vulnerabilities in PLMs, we propose SynGhost, an invisible and universal task-agnostic backdoor.

[Gracefully Filtering Backdoor Samples for Generative Large Language Models without Retraining](https://aclanthology.org/2025.coling-main.220/)

**Zongru Wu**, Pengzhou Cheng, Lingyong Fang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Gongshen Liu

- We reveal a distinct separation between the gradients of backdoor and clean samples in the frequency space. Based on this, we propose Gradient Clustering in the Frequency Space for Backdoor Sample Filtering (GraCeFul), which leverages sample-wise gradients in the frequency space to effectively identify backdoor samples without requiring retraining LLMs.

[Acquiring Clean Language Models from Backdoor Poisoned Datasets by Downscaling Frequency Space](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.441/)

**Zongru Wu**, Zhuosheng Zhang, Pengzhou Cheng, Gongshen Liu 

- We conduct Fourier Analysis to the clean and backdoor mapping and reveal the low-frequency bias on backdoor mapping, which results in the faster convergence of backdoor mapping. Based on this phenomenon, we propose a novel approach that encourages language models to prioritize clean mapping by downscaling in the frequency space, thus efficiently reducing the average success rate of backdoor attacks.
